Secure Triplet Loss Project Repository (https://github.com/jtrpinto/SecureTL)

File: ecg_prepare_uoftdb.py
- Takes the University of Toronto ECG Database (UofTDB) and prepares everything to
  be used in the Secure Triplet Loss training and experiments.
  
  Attention: For best results, the original .mat file that carries all UofTDB data has
  been divided into multiple .txt files, with names 'uoftdb_SUB_SES_FILE.txt', where
  SUB is the subject ID, SES is the session number, and FILE is the posture number
  from the respective session.
